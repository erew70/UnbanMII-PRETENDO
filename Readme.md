# How this works

you are blacklisted much differently on pretendo, if you ever tried using a different lfcs_b that doesnt match your 3ds on pretendo, you notice you will get an error. 



# Error codes:
002-2999: An error has occured please try again later (Invalid Info) 
002-0101: High traffic volume error (Invalid Info)
002-0121: Banned (Valid info but blacklisted, i have tried generating one before and got this error before)
No error: Yay your donor info or generated info worked, you are now successfully unbanned

# Notes
The only question i have from pretendo is how do you know if these are valid? Regex? otherwise you guys clearly have a list of all valid info stored on your servers.
